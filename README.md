# pySinMC
pySinMC (Python Simulation for Molecular Control) is a Python library modeling Quantum Molecular Synthesis (QMS). It demonstrates how to control and mitigate crucial quantum phenomena, like decoherence, essential for precise atomic/molecular matter assembly and manipulation. Full Python code will be available upon work approval for publication.

# Installing Requirements: 

To run simulations for this library, make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then, install the necessary dependencies using 'pip' and the 'requirements.txt' file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
