# pySinMC
pySinMC (Python Simulation for Molecular Control) is a Python library modeling Quantum Molecular Synthesis (QMS). It demonstrates how to control and mitigate crucial quantum phenomena, like decoherence, essential for precise atomic/molecular matter assembly and manipulation. Full Python code will be available upon work approval for publication.
